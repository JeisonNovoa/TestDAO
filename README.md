# Decentralized Governance Platform using Tally

This project is an implementation of a decentralized governance platform that utilizes the Tally tool to facilitate decision-making in a community. It allows members to vote on proposals and express their preferences transparently and securely. The platform integrates with Tally to manage votes and decisions through smart contracts on the Ethereum Tesnet Sepolia network.

## Prerequisites

To interact with this platform, you need an Ethereum wallet compatible with the Ethereum Tesnet Sepolia network, such as Metamask. It is also recommended to have a basic understanding of decentralized governance and how Tally works.

## Installation

There is no need to install this project on your local machine, as all interactions and decision-making take place through the Tally platform and smart contracts on the Ethereum Tesnet Sepolia network.

## Usage

1. Access the Tally platform and search for the "TestDAO".
2. Use your Metamask wallet to connect to the Ethereum Tesnet Sepolia network.
3. Explore active proposals and votes in the DAO and participate in them.
4. If you wish to contribute to the development of this project, you can propose ideas and suggestions in the platform and collaborate directly with the project's source code.

## Contribution

Since this project is based on decentralized governance, contributions primarily take place through the Tally platform and voting in the DAO. If you have ideas or improvements for the project, you can propose them on the platform and subject them to voting for approval by the community.
